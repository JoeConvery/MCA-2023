                <h2>Task 2 - Transcription Errors</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately it turned out that the original score I sourced for my project was too unreadable for the OMR engine,
                   completely corrupting the score and only being able to transcribe a few notes here and there. </p>
                <p>Because of this I decided to source another notated score of the piece that the musescore might actually be able to decifer, 
                   this time from <a href="https://mfiles.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mfiles.co.uk</a>.</p>
                <p>With this new score I was finally able to get a somewhat decent conversion from MuseScore, here are some examples of
                   errors that I still had to correct while fixing the first page of the piece:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It assumed a 120bpm which I had to substitute with a more appropriate "grave"</li>
                    <li>It sometimes mistook crochets for quavers</li>
                    <li>It frequently missed slurs between notes</li>
                    <li>Stacatto indications were commonly missed</li>
                    <li>Clef changes tended to be a few beats off</li>
                    <li>It often got confused about the timesignature of a bar and would add extra beats that I had to correct</li>
                </ul>
