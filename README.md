## Task 1 - Dataset Theme
I have chosen to base my dataset around some of the works of the classical and romantic composer Ludwig van Beethoven. 
For the current task I have chosen to use his piano sonata No.8 in C minor, Op.13, also known as the "pathetique sonata". Specifically, the second movement"Adagio Cantabile".

I chose to focus on this because it's one of my favourite sonatas of all time, especially the beautiful but haunting second movement. 
It's also one of the first pieces I taught myself after finishing my classical piano training, so it holds a special place in my heart.


## Task 2 - Challenges when Working with Music Data
From my experience I think the challenges you face when working with music data heavily depend on the music you are working with. 
For my theme, finding data is not difficult at all due to the prevelance and age of the piece, for a newer or more niche piece of music I could imagine this being very difficult by contrast.

Also luckily in my case, some of the data is old enough that it falls under public domain, like the score I'm using. My audio however is under the "CC BY-NC" license meaning must credit the owner whenever I use it and can't use it for commercial purposes.
