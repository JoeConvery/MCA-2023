## Task 1 - Dataset Theme
I have chosen to base my dataset around some of the works of Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi. For the current task I have chosen to use a piano rendition of "Merry-go-round of Life" from Howl's Moving Castle.

## Task 2 - Challenges when Working with Music Data
Copyright is definitely one of the biggest challenges when finding and using music data. In my example, the score I am using is from MuseScore which requires a subscription to download and print sheetmusic. This will be a common theme with all of Hisashi's work as it is licensed for use within movies. In a related way the recording I'm using is from YouTube which doesn't allow you to export videos or mp3s from their site, even with a subscription. Thankfully there are external platforms which allow this but the legality of these is questionable. 

Additionally this score and recording are not from the original source, they are transcriptions, which means they might not be entirely accurate to Joe Hisaishi's interpretation of the music. Being piano transcriptions of an orchestra some interpretation in that sense is required as well.
